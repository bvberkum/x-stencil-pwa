    `Stencil`_ is a nice framework for developing web-components. Native
    use of JSX and SCSS, ES5 syntax. Part of its `PWA`_ formula is
    provided by `Workbox`_. The rest seems to be some TypeScript config,
    test setup, and the magic CLI glue and web components to get an App
    framework going.
