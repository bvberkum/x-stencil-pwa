<dd><p><a href="https://stenciljs.com/pwa">Stencil</a> is a nice framework for developing web-components. Native use of JSX and SCSS, ES5 syntax. Part of its <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps">PWA</a> formula is provided by <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox">Workbox</a>. The rest seems to be some TypeScript config, test setup, and the magic CLI glue and web components to get an App framework going.</p>
